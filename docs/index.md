# Homework assignments (solutions available via Canvas)

1. Homework 0 (nothing to turn in!): Complete the first three tutorials listed below under "R/RStudio resources". By "complete" I mean follow along with the reading, and make sure you can run all the R commands from within RStudio. It is most helpful if you actually type the commands in yourself, rather than copy and pasting the code. It's tedious at first but helpful for learning. Once you've worked through the tutorials, run the R code accompanying the Section 1.1 lecture notes. Try changing things and see what happens!

# R/RStudio resources

There are many, many resources online for working in R. I have collected a few for you here, and I will continue to update this section throughout the semester:

- [Installing R and RStudio](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/learnR/blob/master/basics/installing_R.md): This should get you up and running with R and RStudio.
- [Installing packages in RStudio](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/learnR/blob/master/basics/installing_library.md): R is more than a single software program; it has the ability to access a central repository of "packages" that add new functionality to R. As of this writing there are over 10,000 R packages in this repository! We will use the mosaic package throughout the semester, so go ahead and install that package following this tutorial.
- [Getting familiar with R](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/learnR/blob/master/heights/heights.md): A quick demo to help get you started in R.
- [Tips on writing code in RStudio's Script pane](http://mercury.webster.edu/aleshunas/R_learning_infrastructure/R%20scripts.html): Tips for creating, loading, editing, and saving R scripts.

Other general resources:

- [R/Rstudio video walkthroughs](https://github.com/brianlukoff/sta371g/blob/master/r-help/getting-more-help.md) The Statistics department at UT Austin has produced a number of video walkthroughs for common tasks in R. 

Specific guidance/extra information:
